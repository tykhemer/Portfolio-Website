    <p>Here, you can find various projects I've created and things I've made in my past. My overall
        goal is to become a game developer. As you can see from the theme of the website; I love Dragon Ball. My
        favorite character from Dragon Ball is Andriod 17, he just has a very cool attitude and a general cool
        personality I always enjoy out of him.</p>
